Plant Monitoring System with Arduino

This project is a plant monitoring system based on an Arduino microcontroller.
It measures temperature, air pressure, air humidity, and soil moisture.
These values help to monitor plant conditions and improve plant care.

Components Used:

Arduino Uno
Adafruit BMP280 sensor for temperature and air pressure
SH1106 OLED display
Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v2.0.0

How It Works:

The sensors continuously collect environmental and soil data.
All measured values are shown in real time on the OLED display.

The system can be used for houseplants, greenhouses, and automated irrigation projects.
